# Mapping_Earthquakes

Overview:

The project's goal is to display and demonstrate the changes in earthquake magnitudes around the world over the last seven days.

To demonstrate the difference in magnitudes of Earthquakes, the coordinates and magnitudes from the Geo JSON DATA were retrieved using JavaScript and the D3.js library. In addition, the Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map via an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

Message to Grader: 
I strive to do a second attempt on this project.
